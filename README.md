# AirBnB_clone - The Console
 This is the first part of a four months long project to build a complete web application as assigned by ALX SE. In this first part of the project, a command Interpreter for managing the creation, update, retrieve and destruction of objects was built using the python programming language.

"Structure of the project"

`Storage engine -> Json file.`
`Console -> cmd with python library cmd.Cmd`

# Description of the project
This particular part of the project is the foundation for the full clone of the airbnb web application page(though, not all functionalities in the site is incorporated, it nonetheless incorporates the core functionality of the site).The project uses the python object oriented programming paradigm and necessary library modules which aid greatly in the total abstraction of the storage system(s) for the application making it adapt independently to any storage medium or environment.

# Prerequisites 

Python3.4+ has to be installed if you desire to use the console:
```
sudo apt-get install python3
```

# Installation

To have access to the console use the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:matthiasVincent/AirBnB_clone.git; cd AirBnB_clone
```

# Run

If you want to execute the console use:

```
python3 console.py
```
or
```
./console.py
```

# Testing 

If you want to personalize the classes and execute unit tests to confirm that your changes haven't modify the functionality use:

```
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```

# Use

## Available commands
|Command| Explanation |
|--|--|
| create | Creates a new instance of `BaseModel`, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the `id`. Ex: `$ create BaseModel`  |
| show | Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and `id`. Ex: `$ show BaseModel 1234-1234-1234` |
| all | Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. Ex: `$ all BaseModel` |
| update | Updates an instance based on the class name and `id` by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the JSON file). Ex: `$ update BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 email "aibnb@holbertonschool.com"` |

## Normal command input

|Command| Example|
|--|--|
|create| create [class name] |
|show| show [class name] [id] |
|all| create [class name] [id]|
|update| create [class name] [id] [arg_name] [arg_value]|


## Alternative command input
|Command| Example|
|--|--|
|[class name].all()| User.all() |
|[class name].count()| User.count() |
|[class name].show()| User.show() |
|[class name].destroy()| User.destroy() |
|[class name].update([id], [attribute name], [attribute value].all()| User.update("38f22813-2753-4d42-b37c-57a17f1e4f88", "first_name", "Moses") |
|(class name).update([id], [dictionary representation])| User.update("38f22813-2753-4d42-b37c-57a17f1e4f88", {'first_name': "Moses", "age": 89}) |

## Available classes
|Class name| Attributes|
|--|--|
| BaseModel | `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`  |
| User| `email`, `password`, `first_name`, `last_name` |
| State| `name` `state_id`|
| City| `name`  |
| Amenity | `name` |
| Place | `city_id` `user_id` `name` `description` `number_rooms` `number_bathrooms` `max_guest` `price_by_night` `latitude``longitude` `amenity_ids` |
| Review| `place_id` `user_id` `text` |

* every model inherits attributes from BaseModel

## The console can be run in:

### Interactive Mode
```
$ ./console.py
```

Now you are on interactive mode and you will see the prompt `(hbnb)`
input a command:

```
(hbnb) create User
```
the id of the created model will be visible in the standard output, if you do:

```
(hbnb) show User [id]
```

All the attributes of the created model will be in your screen.

use: 

```
(hbnb) help
```
For a list of usable commands, to exit press Ctrl+D or type the command quit.

### Non-Interactive Mode

The console can also be used in non-interactive mode:

```
$ echo "create User" | ./console.py

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
```

The program will create a file called: `file.json` whenever you create a new model. It is always created in the same directory as console.py.
