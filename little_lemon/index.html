                    The tale of how the Tortoise tied the Lion, the acclaimed king of the jungle to a tree in its \ own domicile was a satiric one,  uncovering the evil adventures of the supposed wealthy and strong people in the society.

                            Enechojo's grandmother, who she grew up with, was gifted with the power of predicting the future. In fact, she was a great seer during her time. During this time, her fame as a seer  spread to the neighbouring communities and beyond. The most striking thing about her own power of divination was that, there was no shrine  or  any other form of spiritual accessories and artefacts as applicable to other seers, in her house. Even when she became blind at her advanced age, people still flooded her house to find out what the future held for them.  The physical two eyes concerned most on issues in the physical realm while the third eye called, the spiritual eye  hallmarked  the realm of the spirits.
